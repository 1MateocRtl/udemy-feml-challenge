Final challenge / assignment for the Udemy course: Feature Engineering for Machine Learning

## Assignment:

Beat the performance of my Lasso regression by using different feature engineering steps **ONLY!!**.

The performance of my current model, as shown in this notebook is:

    test rmse: 44798.497576784845
    test r2: 0.7079639526659389

To beat my model you will need a test r2 bigger than 0.71 and a rmse smaller than 44798.

=====================================================================
### Conditions:

 - You MUST NOT change the hyperparameters of the Lasso.
 - You MUST use the same seeds in Lasso and train_test_split as I show in this notebook (random_state)
 - You MUST use all the features of the dataset (except Id) - you MUST NOT select features

======================================================================

If you beat my model:

Make a pull request with your notebook to this github repo: https://github.com/solegalli/udemy-feml-challenge

#### How to make the PR

1) fork the repo:

Go to https://github.com/solegalli/udemy-feml-challenge, and click on the fork button at the top-right

2) clone your forked repo into your local computer:

- Go to www.github.com/yourusername/udemy-feml-challenge
- Click the green button that says clone or download
- copy the url that opens up
- Power up a git console
- Type: 
	`git clone (paste the url you copied from github)`
- done

3) Make a copy of the jupyter notebook and add your name:

- Open up the Jupyter notebook called 13-Assignement.ipynb
- Click the "File" button at the top-right and then click "Make a copy"
- Work your solution in the Copy and **not in the original assignment** (otherwise there will be conflicts when making the PR)
- Change the name of the copy of the notebook to: **13-Assignement_yourname.ipynb**
- Done

When you finish, just commit the new notebook to your fork and then make a PR to my repo

### But I have a notebook ready and I haven't cloned the repo yet, how can I make the PR?

If you worked in the copy you downloaded from Udemy before forking and cloning this repo, then follow this steps:

1) fork the repo:

Go to https://github.com/solegalli/udemy-feml-challenge, and click on the fork button at the top-right

2) clone your forked repo into your local computer:

Go to www.github.com/yourusername/udemy-feml-challenge

- Click the green button that says clone or download
- Copy the url that opens up
- Power up a git console
- Type: `git clone (paste the url you copied from github)`
- Done

3) Rename your solution as follows and copy it into your cloned repo:

- Rename your solution notebook to: 13-Assignement_yourname.ipynb
- Copy this file into the cloned repo
- Done

When you finish, just commit the new notebook to your fork and then make a PR to my repo

Good luck!!
